## Executive Summary
### Primary Goal
The main goal is to develop a functional and visually engaging Excel dashboard that analyses four years of transactional sales data from Adventure Works. It focuses on refining data interpretation skills, enhancing storytelling through visualisations, and applying structured methodologies for business insight generation. The dashboard is designed to highlight key performance patterns and support data-informed decision-making.
